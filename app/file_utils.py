Resume File Processing Module

This module provides utilities for handling and processing resume file uploads in the
ElevatrAI platform. It supports extracting text content from PDF and Word documents
(DOC/DOCX) while maintaining memory efficiency and security.

Key Features:
- Memory-efficient file processing using BytesIO
- Support for PDF and Word document formats
- Secure file handling with format validation
- Clean error handling with descriptive messages

Dependencies:
    - PyPDF2: For PDF file processing
    - python-docx: For Word document processing
    - werkzeug: For secure file handling

    Extract text content from an uploaded resume file safely and efficiently.
    
    This function processes resume uploads by:
    1. Validating the file format (PDF/DOC/DOCX)
    2. Reading the file content into memory safely
    3. Extracting text based on file type
    4. Performing basic content validation
    
    Args:
        file (FileStorage): The uploaded file object from a Flask request
        
    Returns:

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the file is missing, format is unsupported, or text extraction fails
        
    Example:
        from flask import request
        
        @app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
        def handle_upload():
            file = request.files['resume']
